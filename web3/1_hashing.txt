# Hashing is a process that transforms input data (of any size) into a fixed-size string of characters.

# Hash functions have several important properties:

1. Deterministic: 
    The same input will always produce the same output.
2. Fast computation: 
    The hash value can be quickly computed for any given data.
3. Pre-image resistance: 
    It should be computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function (i.e., find the original input given its hash output).
4. Small changes in input produce large changes in output: 
    Even a tiny change in the input should drastically change the hash output.
5. Collision resistance: 
    It should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.
